#### About this Project

The social cost of housing instability is enormous. It affects the physical health, mental well-being, 
employment, and educational attainment of individuals and families. 

Housing instability threatens the security of entire communities and burdens already limited social safety nets. 
While an involuntary move is extremely harmful, the threat of eviction can also have significant detrimental 
effects on both individuals and communities. 

Yet research shows that housing instability is rooted not in individual or community failures, 
but in policies of exclusion, displacement, disinvestment, and discrimination. 

What are the specific landlord behaviors that cause the most harm? How can we better understand them and 
where they are happening in ways that could support intervention? 

This dashboard joins eviction data with demographic information to visualize trends in landlord behavior 
to aid housing justice advocates across the state in identifying neighborhoods that need support. Our goal is
that by making this information publicly accessible, we can shift the lens to those in power and support
informed discussion for policy changes.
